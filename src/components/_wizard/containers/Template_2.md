PART 1 GENERAL

$$=1.1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

$$3 General

The Contractor shall retrofit the selected space into an Alternate Care Facility (ACF) to serve to serve ambulatory, non-critical patients. This effort is to provide an Alternate Care Facility meeting basic healthcare functions with an emphasis on patient care, infection control, fire protection, and life safety. Advantages to the user of this space are greater patient density enabling a reduction in healthcare workers and faster construction time as well as greater use of prefabricated construction (e.g. Portable Bathroom Trailers, Conex for support service spaces etc.). The ACF shall serve as a satellite patient ward supported by a nearby full service hospital. The full service hospital would provide the logistics, materials and waste management support, nutrition care etc.
