A living room, laundry and full service kitchen shall be shared by the room module occupants.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.    The administrative building function is to provide soldier mission direction and operational needs requirements.  This facility will operate in a similar manner as the Battalion and Brigade headquarters facilities and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to an office building.  The Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) serves as a transitional facility, which bridges the gap between in the transition between family assistance and assisting the soldier in personal adjustments.  Soldier assistance by family members is critical element in the recovery from injuries.  Child care areas, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistance type functions to accommodate both the soldier and their families are provided in this facility.     All of the WT facilities together form a complex and provides a cohesive mission in the healing process of the soldier.  The Government reserves the right to solicit this facility type separately, if determined to be in the best interests of the Government, through approval of an amendment to the acquisition plan. It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., “adapt-build” and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.',

    Description:
      'This project is a congressional insert from 2012. It is to construct part of  the first barracks and company operations facility for  an Advance Individual Training (AIT) complex that will eventually occupy much of the site on A Ave. Due to space limitations at Ft Lee Virginia. The Barracks portion will consist of a 5 story barracks using the previous AIT at Fort Lee PN 96122 an FY 09 facility as the basis of design for this barracks. The normal 5 story AIT barracks at Fort Lee will have 300 sleeping modules capable of housing 600 AIT Solders under normal conditions and up to 900 solders during surge conditions. Due to lack of swing space and existing facilities in the area that cannot be demolished until after this project is occupied, only 150 of the sleeping modules plus the core admin facilities will be able to be constructed for this project. The remainder 150 Sleeping modules will be constructed at a later date under a separate contract. It will be necessary for this contractor to keep this in mind and design this project so that the additional modules can be easily added by any contractor under a separate contract without extensive modifications or demolition of this facility. The primary facilities for this contract include 1 AIT company barracks with 2 company operations (Army), and 1 1000 sf  storage facility. Project includes installation of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), connection to Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS), and Information Systems. Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service, water, sewer, and gas; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements; information systems.',

The WT facilities will house soldiers temporarily while they are recuperating from injuries sustained during their service in the United States and overseas fighting the Global War on Terror (GWoT).  These facilities will provide the best accommodations the Army can build in gratitude for their service and sacrifice.  The Warrior in Transition Complex consists of four facility elements: WT Barracks to accommodate 224 recuperating soldiers in 112 Suites within a three-story, 134,960 square-foot facility.  The barracks will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar, both functionally and technically, to apartment-type housing in the private sector.  The rooms shall be either fully handicap accessible or "adaptable" and shall include: private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, and at least one bathroom in each dwelling unit.  A living room, laundry and full service kitchen shall be shared within each dwelling unit by the occupants.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  WT Soldier and Family Assistance Center (SFAC) in a single-story, 15,000 square-foot facility.  The Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) serves as a transitional facility, bridging the gap between supervised care and family assistance as well as assisting the soldier in personal adjustments.  Soldier assistance by family members is a critical element in the recovery from injuries.  A Child care area, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistance-type functions, to accommodate both the soldier and their families, are provided in this facility.   A Combined Administrative Building, housing two WT “Medium” Company Headquarters and one WT Battalion Headquarters in a two-story, 27,200 square foot facility.  The Company Headquarters portion of the building will support two Companies with administrative building functions to provide soldier mission direction and meet operational needs requirements.  The Battalion Headquarters will operate in a similar manner as traditional Battalion and Brigade headquarters facilities.  This facility is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to an office building. WT Dining Facility (DFAC) with a 201-500 person serving capacity in a single-story, 18,000 square foot facility.This project shall be for the design and construction of the Soldier and Family Assistance Center, and the Company Headquarters / Battalion Headquarters Facility with associated and immediately adjacent site infrastructure.  Refer to the Demarcation Matrix for a more specific breakdown of responsibilities. Another RFP has been (will be) issued for the WT Barracks Facility, full complex pad/site grading, and complex infrastructure.  A third RFP has been (will be) issued for the Dining Facility with associated and immediately adjacent site infrastructure.',

      'Design and Construct a standard Dining facility and associated sitework  The Work of this project is one of three projects included in the Warrior in Transition (WT) Campus at Ft. Knox.  The WT facilities will house soldiers temporarily while they are recuperating from injuries sustained during their service in the United States and overseas fighting the Global War on Terror (GWoT).  These facilities will provide the best accommodations the Army can build in gratitude for their service and sacrifice.  The Warrior in Transition Complex consists of four facility elements: •   WT Barracks to accommodate 216 recuperating soldiers in 108 Suites in a three-story, 126,390 square foot facility.  The barracks will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The ground-floor suites shall be completely handicap accessible and shall include: private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, and a bathroom for each soldier.  A living room, laundry and full service kitchen shall be shared by the room module occupants.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work. •   WT Soldier and Family Assistance Center (SFAC) in a single-story, 15,000 square foot facility.  The Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) serves as a transitional facility, which bridges the gap between in the transition between family assistance and assisting the soldier in personal adjustments.  Soldier assistance by family members is critical element in the recovery from injuries.  Child care areas, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistance type functions to accommodate both the soldier and their families are provided in this facility. •   A combined WT Medium Company Headquarters and WT Battalion Headquarters in a two-story, 26,800 square foot facility.  The Company Headquarters will support two Companies with administrative building functions to provide soldier mission direction and operational needs requirements.  The Battalion Headquarters will operate in a similar manner as traditional Battalion and Brigade headquarters facilities.  This facility is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to an office building. •   WT Dining Facility (DFAC) for a 201-500 person serving capacity in a single-story, 18,000 square foot facility.  This project shall be for the design and construction of the Dining Facility with associated and immediately adjacent site infrastructure.  Refer to the Demarcation Matrix for a more specific breakdown of responsibilities.  Another RFP has been (will be) issued for the WT Barracks, full complex pad site grading and complex infrastructure.  And a third RFP has been (will be) issued for the Soldier and Family Assistance Center, and the Company OPS Headquarters / Battalion Headquarters with associated and immediately adjacent site infrastructure.
